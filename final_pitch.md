Do test (D.C. CAPE) scores and graduation rates align with funding in D.C. schools? Data containing funding for D.C. schools could reveal how location directly influences the education children receive in schools across the district. I also want to find the relationship between public funding and private funding and the scores students get in public schools, public charter schools, and private schools. Are students who attend certain schools with more funding guaranteed higher test scores in math and literacy? Is there any relation between the quality of education students receive and funding?

This project could build a data set for future reference to observe how funding may directly impact education. Though at first thought, many would think the impact is negative, if disproved, the data could highlight what else schools rely on to prevent low test scores other than funding.

There’s been some research in academia about the effects of funding in education, but no formal reporting of it in the district. The topic is also a sentiment held in the school system already, that low funding results in low retention rates.

This could be a possible accountability story of how funding serves as academic favoritism toward neighborhoods, quadrants, and schools.
