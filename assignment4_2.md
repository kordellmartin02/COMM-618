Do test scores align with funding in D.C. schools? Data containing funding for D.C. schools could reveal how location directly influences the education children receive in schools across the district. I also want to find the relationship between public funding and private funding and the scores students get in public schools, public charter schools, and private schools. Are students who attend certain schools with more funding guaranteed higher test scores in math and literacy? Is there any relation between the quality of education students receive and funding?

I want to collect school scores in tests, which could be separated data, like scores in math and literacy. I want to also collect school funding totals for various schools across the district, preferably those in different wards and quadrants, to compare. This could be gathered within a single year, or I could compare school funding rates across the last 5 years.

Since this information is governmental, the data could be collected from D.C. government offices like the D.C. State Board of Education or district-oriented data within the U.S. Department of Education. I'm confident that I won't need any particular information, but if I do have concerns about missing information that would make my project complete, I would need permission to access that data.

I would interview officials, but I have found some data online for the initial method of data collection. Information in approved budget documents and test score (DC CAPE) reviews can be found online to be used in my study.
