I find this to be a good source because it is directly from the District of Columbia Board of Elections. They have various voter registration statistics that change every month due to new people registering. The source seems timely and truthful since they stay up to date with information. All wards are represented in the data set, and the numbers don’t seem false or inflated. Various parties that voters can register for are included in the data, so even if they aren’t large totals, they can be seen by anyone willing to look at them. It also does a good job of not lumping parties with less popularity than the Democratic and Republican parties in an “other” category. The data set also included party percentages to simplify the addition of population totals. This can also be fact-checked by searching for population statistics in DC. Though it may be okay to cite political sources, this source doesn’t seem like it falsifies information since it is a governmental office. Data sets from previous months also show the slow rise or fall of registered voters. Various voter registration statistics from more than 12 years ago also portray the source as trustworthy and consistent.
