Despite the district appearing as an overwhelmingly Democratic area, the second largest demographic appears to be voters who identify with a No Party preference. Despite being the ward most popular by voters, Ward 5 does not have the most No Party preference voters, unlike its high Democratic numbers. The largest ward with No Party preference voters is Ward 6, whose voter total does contrast from Ward 5 by about 400 voters.

No Party preference voters are also the largest minority in the district, trumping parties like the Republican and D.C. Statehood Green Party. Lower numbers for No Party preference voters appear in wards 4, 7, and 8, despite being more densely populated among all wards. No Party preference voting does not appear to be unpopular in the district, in any wards.

Ward 6 contains the most Republican numbers out of any ward, while being the second most voter-populated area. Ward 5, the area with the largest number of voters, contrasts these numbers by hosting almost half of the Republican voters that appear in Ward 6. Other parties are similarly not as popular in any ward across the district. They tend to stay in the same range, never increasing above 500 voters.
